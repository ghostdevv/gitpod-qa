Use this feature to automate the storage and retrieval of a .env file when workspaces are created.\nteaserImage: header.png\nimage: teaser.png\n---\n\nWorking with ephemeral developer environments has many advantages. When every new workspace starts from a clean slate, you never have to worry about uncommitted changes causing problems.\n\nBut sometimes you want uncommitted changes. Some things (configuration, secrets, etc) just shouldn't enter source control.\n\nIn a long-lived development environment, you can leave a `.env` file on the file system and it will survive the length of your project.

You can close and reopen that workspace as many times as you want and your `.env` file will still be there, but those who embrace ephemeral development wholeheartedly and want a new workspace for each task will quickly notice they need to set everything up again.\n\nSo how do you persist a file between workspaces without committing it to source control? You store it securely in a database.\n\nThe most convenient database to use is Gitpod's workspace environment variable storage. You can encode your `.env` file as a base64 string, and use the `gp` tool to store it in a Gitpod environment variable. You can then automate restoring from the environment variable to keep the .env persisted between workspaces.\n\nThe Gitpod CLI is built-in: simply run `gp env DOTENV=value` and you will be able to read `$DOTENV` in every workspace.

That's great! I'm here to help you achieve this. 👍\n\nIn this guide, I will be using Gitpod, a free developer service that makes it easy for maintainers to automate any non-executable setup instructions as code. If you follow it, you will end up with a button that launches pre-configured containers for your project, thus allowing everyone to check out your repository and run your code in a single click.\n\nThe first thing you'll probably want to do is try opening your repository in Gitpod. You can do this by navigating to your GitHub project root, and then typing `gitpod.io/#` before the URL. It should look a bit like this:\n\n```bash\ngitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/website","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/guides/gitpodify","loc":{"lines":{"from":35,"to":44}}}}],["70",{"pageContent":"```\n\n<br>\n\nWhen you see the IDE and Terminal, just try building and running your project as usual. Maybe it will just work out of the box, but maybe you'll notice that something is missing or broken, and you can iterate on your Gitpod setup to fix it (see table of contents below).\n\nOnce you're happy with your automated setup, a cool way to guide your contributors toward it is to add a Gitpod badge to your README. Here is a Markdown snippet you can use (just replace the `...` with your repo):\n\n```markdown\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/...)\n```\n\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/website)\n\nHappy with your onboarding experience?

Reservations also apply for when instances are not running, so the cost savings from the reservations needs to outweigh the cost of the reservations when instances are not running (i.e. likely outside of work hours). This is because reserved instances are billed on an hourly basis and are reserved for every hour of the reservation period (e.g. 1year).

Next, open the Debug panel (also in the IDE's left vertical menu bar), and click on the Gear (⚙️) icon to open the `launch.json` configuration file\n\n4.

Before you can start installing Gitpod, you need to create a compatible Kubernetes cluster. The [reference architectures](./reference-architecture) will help you to get started with your favorite cloud provider. If you are creating a cluster yourself, it's up to you to set up a cluster that meets the [requirements](./requirements).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary  class=\"text-p-medium\"><b>Cert-Manager installed on the cluster</b></summary>","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/installing-gitpod","loc":{"lines":{"from":15,"to":27}}}}],["1397",{"pageContent":"</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary  class=\"text-p-medium\"><b>Cert-Manager installed on the cluster</b></summary>\n\nOnce you have created your Kubernetes cluster you need to install [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/). cert-manager is needed even when you bring your own TLS certificate for your domain.

The DNS setup to your domain needs to be configured such that it points to the ingress of your Kubernetes cluster. You need to configure your actual domain (say `example.com`) as well as the wildcard subdomains `*.example.com` and `*.ws.example.com`. Alternatively, you can rely on a configured `Issuer`/`ClusterIssuer` plus a `Certificate` (that also includes the wildcard domains) for cert-manager:","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/installing-gitpod","loc":{"lines":{"from":27,"to":39}}}}],["1398",{"pageContent":"**Creating TLS certs for your domain with cert-manager**\n\ncert-manager provides the Gitpod installation with certificates for internal communication. Besides this, cert-manager can also create a TLS certificate for your domain.

Please consult the [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01) for instructions. You can use either an [`Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer`](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer).\n\nFollowing the cert-manager instructions, you will have an `Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer` with a configured `dns01` solver (most probably with a proper secret with credentials for your DNS provider) as well a `Certificate` with the following `dnsNames`:\n\n-   `example.com`\n-   `*.example.com`\n-   `*.ws.example.com`\n\n_(replace `example.com` with your Gitpod domain)_\n\n</details>","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/installing-gitpod","loc":{"lines":{"from":41,"to":53}}}}],["1399",{"pageContent":"## Install Gitpod\n\nTo start with installing Gitpod, you need a terminal where you can run `kubectl` against your cluster.
