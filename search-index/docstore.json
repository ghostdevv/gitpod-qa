That glue itself is developer experience. **How can we productively use all these tools?**\n\n- The DevX that made Cirpo mind explode was the first time he customised his terminal to be colourful. The reason this was mind blowing was because “back in the day”, it was black and white. Now with the infinite customisation opportunities, **developers can really feel like their toolkit works _for_ them.**","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/blog/building-devx-teams","loc":{"lines":{"from":41,"to":45}}}}],["75",{"pageContent":"- Lou shared an integration that was built at DAZN. Something that he has wanted in every single tool since and that is **an integrated error map.** This error map helps devs understand what is going on when they hit an issue so they can unblock themselves quicker and stay in flow. This is exactly what developer experience is all about!\n\n- Even if you don’t have the time to integrate some StackOverFlow like solution into your product, Cirpo reminds us that **sometimes the most simple actions can have a big impact on DevX.** For instance, writing meaningful error suggestions could make someone’s experience trying to debug issues 100x better.\n\n- The final parts of our fun conversation, we all shared our hopes and dreams of DevX. Cirpo’s answer was one that we needed to highlight. He hopes that in the future, we all move towards a more **360 degrees approach** in DevX.

There was one problem left: components that make VS Code as an application complete compared to the open source repository [Code - OSS](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) are proprietary, including access to Microsoft services such as the VS Code extension marketplace. To fill that gap we built and released the [Open VSX marketplace](https://open-vsx.org/) as an open-source alternative, which we also donated to Eclipse.

Prior to founding Forthright - a developer experience consultancy - Kurt has extensive experience in **developer relations working in advocacy** at various companies from AWS, GraphQL to Gatsby.\n\n- Previous guests on DevXPod we’ve primarily discussed **developer experience in the context of in-product experience with the tools** itself. Kurt describes DevX as, _“an event or an occurrence within an ecosystem that leaves an impression on a developer.” _ This can include out-of-product experiences such as support, community, docs and content.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/blog/devrel-link-devx","loc":{"lines":{"from":29,"to":33}}}}],["192",{"pageContent":"- _“If I'm asking even another person for help and I have a bad experience, I tie that to the company. So we can't pin developer experience down to just ‘I build integrations.’”_ With this in mind, **it naturally makes sense that developer relations which is often the out-of-product experience falls naturally in making sure developer experience is positive.** Kurt wrote a fantastic article about this, check it out [here](https://theworst.dev/developer-experience)!","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/blog/devrel-link-devx","loc":{"lines":{"from":35,"to":35}}}}],["193",{"pageContent":"- To be effective in the growing developer experience space, Kurt recommends that **the best skills to hone aren’t engineering-specific skills but technical writing, empathy and the ability to prioritise.** _“I actually think the lack of specificity it's going to do us a significant amount of damage as companies try and understand DevX and build that out as they grow.”_ Although these roles are very fluid, we’re starting to see specialisation areas including community builders, docs educator, DevX engineering (_i.e. building pipelines and infrastructure_.)\n\n- DevX is increasing in relevancy to everyone in tech. For example, Mike noted how many people have recently announced their new DevX jobs on Twitter. Kurt mentioned that he’s seen **a DevX role in the first 10 hires at start-ups.** Both of these showcase how important DevX is more than ever! _“2022 is the year of developer experience!”_","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/blog/devrel-link-devx","loc":{"lines":{"from":37,"to":39}}}}],["194",{"pageContent":"- Additionally, developer experience is important to bring more developers into tech.

Engineers are more likely to join a company with a better experience, in some cases that could be a determining factor.\n\n- When sharing some of the best developer experiences Kurt has seen, he reflected on the time he had built Bert CLI for PHP where he had the first taste of building to improve the lives of other developers.

You can think of it as an online IDE with deep GitHub integration (and soon other platforms), providing fully-featured developer environments with a single click for any GitHub project, issue, branch or pull request.\n\n**Automation**","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/blog/github-flow","loc":{"lines":{"from":25,"to":29}}}}],["330",{"pageContent":"**Automation**\n\nStarting a workspace with Gitpod is much easier than with other cloud IDEs. Gitpod doesn’t require you to configure workspaces with container images, Git information and so on. Instead, you directly go to a GitHub repository and click the Gitpod-Button [see below]. Gitpod provides you with a ready to use workspace, so that you can immediately start coding without any configuration steps.\n\n![Button provided by Gitpod’s browser extension](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*MjUIJ1zspz3CF8oo)_Button provided by Gitpod’s browser extension_\n\n> To see the Gitpod button on the GitHub page, you would have to [install a browser extension](https://gitpod.io). Alternatively, you can manually prefix any GitHub URL with `https://gitpod.io/#`. For instance, clicking the following link will instantly provide you a development workspace for the Eclipse Theia project: [https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/theia-ide/theia](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/theia-ide/theia)","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/blog/github-flow","loc":{"lines":{"from":29,"to":35}}}}],["331",{"pageContent":"Of course, different projects need different setups. Gitpod has a three-stage process to determine the workspace configuration, e.g. what Docker image to use for development, what startup script to run, and which ports to expose:\n\n1. It first looks for a _.gitpod_ configuration file in the repository. Note, that it will check the state of the currently viewed commit. This allows you to keep working configuration for old states as well as trying a new configuration in a pull request.\n\n1. Second, if there is no configuration in the cloned repository, a central repository called ‘[definitely-gp](https://github.com/gitpod-io/definitely-gp)’ is checked for configuration. It is a public repository which contains configurations for arbitrary GitHub projects. That is useful if you want to provide configuration for a repository you don’t have write access to.

You can put that configuration under version control, replacing the onboarding documentation with a formal, executable description. But there is more information in a GitHub URL that can be leveraged to keep us in the flow.\n\n**It’s All About The Context**\n\nWhen creating a workspace, Gitpod will analyze the provided GitHub URL.

Gitpod puts you into the right context, by automatically creating a local branch using the issue number and even pre-configures the commit message accordingly. All is set up for you to start coding and testing. Once you are happy with the changes you made, use the Git integration to create a commit and push it to a remote branch. Finally, you can even create the actual pull request right from within Gitpod.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/blog/github-flow","loc":{"lines":{"from":51,"to":51}}}}],["334",{"pageContent":"Lastly, of course, when clicking the Gitpod button on a pull request, Gitpod beams you right into code review mode.

And because it is a full IDE, we can navigate through the entire code base, run code or add commits at will.

So let’s talk about the IDE that powers Gitpod.\n\nTheia is an open-source project that has been in development for over a year now. In addition to the TypeFox team, other companies like Ericsson and RedHat are actively contributing to it. The Eclipse Che team is replacing their existing IDE with Theia, and companies like IBM already have [public offers](https://microclimate-dev2ops.github.io/) based on it. Theia just recently became an Eclipse project, to make sure it is developed in a truly open and democratic manner and that no single company is controlling its future.\n\nEven with all that momentum, it seems to be an unrealistic effort to develop a new IDE from scratch. Just consider how many years of development were put into projects like the classic Eclipse IDE or Visual Studio.

Monaco is the code editor that supports VS Code and is very flexible, high-quality code editor written in TypeScript (JavaScript). Unlike VS Code, the Monaco editor widget can run in browsers.\n\nThe second ingredient is the use of protocols. The most popular one being the language server protocol [4].\n\n**The [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)**\n\nThe LSP is an effort started by VS Code to allow using language services in a technology- and UI-independent manner. One of the first popular reusable language services came from the TypeScript team.

If something is missing, it is a good idea to search the web as the list is incomplete and new language servers are released every other week. If you want to build your own language server, there are SDKs for various languages ranging from TypeScript, Java and C# to Haskell. Finally, [Xtext](https://github.com/theia-ide/theia-xtext) provides a full framework for implementing a language server for domain-specific languages.\n\nThe LSP allows moving mature code bases for language smartness to the future. The very popular Java language server which is not only used in Theia but also in Atom and VS Code is really a headless version of Eclipse’s Java Development tools.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/blog/github-flow","loc":{"lines":{"from":77,"to":79}}}}],["339",{"pageContent":"Theia uses and supports other protocols as well. For instance, debugging support is in the works and will support the Debug Adapter Protocol which connects Theia to 50+ existing debuggers.\n\n**Extensibility**\n\nBesides the ability to run Theia in browsers there is another important difference to VS Code: VS Code extensions are limited to what is exposed in the VS Code’s extension API. For instance, it is not possible to create a new view in a VS code extension. This is a serious blocker for more advanced extensions. Contrarily in Theia where extensions are first class building blocks an extension can deep integration and make use of everything. Even fully white-labeled products are possible due to its flexible architecture.

Some action items are taking a little longer to implement though, and these items are exactly the ones that will solve the problem mentioned before: _we need to get better at proactively identify degraded user experience._","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/blog/journey-to-site-reliability-engineering-at-gitpod","loc":{"lines":{"from":35,"to":35}}}}],["533",{"pageContent":"Alerting on symptoms instead of causes\n\nUnfortunately, today we can't have clear insights if our changes have a direct impact on user experience.

Ready-to-code means that developers can actually start writing code and don’t have to wait for builds, dependencies to download or code generators to run.\n\nWith GitHub Codespaces and other solutions whenever you start a new dev environment, you are left with a raw copy of the code. So before you start writing code, you’ll need to run a bunch of processes and wait until they are finished.\n\nInstead Gitpod prebuilds dev environments when a new commit is pushed to the remote repository.

Can we poke the black box to give us the information that we want?”_\n\n- **Codebases are constantly changing and increasingly getting more complex.** Filling developers’ time and mental space with trying to understand all the changing dependencies can slowly eat away at your developer productivity.

You can have multiple workspaces with different contexts open at once - one for your feature, one for a bug, or one for your code review directly in Gitpod.\n\n# What is Qovery?","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/blog/qovery-and-gitpod","loc":{"lines":{"from":34,"to":40}}}}],["742",{"pageContent":"# What is Qovery?\n\n[Qovery](https://www.qovery.com/) is a platform delivering Environments as a Service in your Cloud, where you can build, deploy and test in production-like environments.

Developers can instantly spin up production-like environments and start shipping in seconds.\n\nQovery introduced the concept of on-demand environments where dev teams can test code changes in isolation by generating Preview environments on every Pull Request.\n\nA preview environment is as good as other deployment environments, e.g., Production, Staging, etc., because it is equipped with everything needed for proper testing in isolation. That includes infrastructure, updated products, integrations, databases, configuration, etc. A preview environment is better than traditional deployment environments because it is super easy to provision and de-provision a preview environment.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/blog/qovery-and-gitpod","loc":{"lines":{"from":40,"to":46}}}}],["743",{"pageContent":"Perfectly integrated with the developer's workflows, the Qovery UI simplifies deployment, debugging, and monitoring from a unified interface.

Re-connect to workspaces without needing to go back to the Gitpod dashboard.\n2.

The SSH protocol is flexible, so there are many use-cases, but to give you an idea, here are some different use-cases:\n\n1. **Static connection strings** - The access token method of [copy/paste SSH](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/copy-paste-ssh-workspace-access) generates a new workspace access token for each workspace start, meaning users had to go to the Gitpod dashboard to retrieve their SSH command on every workspace timeout or restart.

On workspace update, you'll still be required to update the SSH string.

This complex architecture’s side effects often led to slow start-up times, a bloated IDE and extensions depending on specific versions. The mindset of loading everything in the same process implied that every extension had to be written in Java, but what about other languages?\n\nOver time slow and bloated software can leave folks wondering if there are alternatives - something that could relieve the pain of those downsides!\n\nAnd then...

For hackathons, this is even more true. In the case of Vizlib, [a five-day hackathon](https://astrato.io/blog/astrato-hackathon-innovating-and-improving-our-features-for-you/) was held to focus the team on the rapid development of new features and improvements for their new product, Astrato– a modern fully managed Cloud BI solution.\n\nNaturally, the last thing the team wanted was to waste time on dealing with configuration, setup tasks and making changes to their developer environment. But that was the exact challenge – since engineers from various areas with different dev stacks came together to collaborate towards the same goal and product. Making changes to running local developer environments was not an option to avoid breaking them for when they return to their regular work. Plus, compatibility issues with the Astrato workflow on Windows added another layer of complexity.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/customers/vizlib","loc":{"lines":{"from":92,"to":96}}}}],["1123",{"pageContent":"> “We needed a fast way to make everyone ready to code in just one hour without touching the local environments.”\n\nThe CTO, Konrad Mattheis, explored cloud developer environments as an option to solve these challenges and started evaluating Gitpod.\n\nUsing remote development would firstly ensure that local developer environments remained untouched. And since Gitpod provisions powerful Linux containers under the hood, the OS compatibility wouldn’t be an issue either. Having a standardized configuration to provide everyone with the right set and versions of tools at the click of a button ensured consistency with no “but it works on my machine” surprises.\n\n> “Gitpod checked all the boxes, so all 72 participants used it throughout the hackathon week.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/customers/vizlib","loc":{"lines":{"from":98,"to":104}}}}],["1124",{"pageContent":"> “Gitpod checked all the boxes, so all 72 participants used it throughout the hackathon week.”\n\nKonrad Mattheis explained that the deep focus on development allowed for much higher productivity. Given the collaborative nature of hackathons, Gitpod’s features such as sharing running workspaces for pair programming or sharing snapshots of workspaces let the teams collaborate much closer and more efficiently. The hackathon was a huge success and resulted in 10 new features or improvements to Astrato, more than initially expected.

CTO Konrad Mattheis noted that the hackathon acted as a catalyst, making it more obvious that the aforementioned challenges are not exclusive to hackathons but significantly impact the day-to-day work of their engineering organization. Vizlib develops on a dockerized Kubernetes Stack with only full-stack engineers that use a variety of machines with different operating systems.

Vizlib estimates that every engineer saves a minimum of two hours per week, purely by not having to fix their developer environments anymore. Excluding efficiency gains through increased flow state and more efficient collaboration.\n\nIt also made the development process more robust by having fewer differences across the developer and production environments and allowing for better testing.

In the past, it took two days for an engineer to set up their dev environment, while it now only takes around an hour to get started.\n\nTo support the rapid business growth, Vizlib plans to hire five additional product squads with 10 FTE each during 2022 (see Vizlib’s [career page](https://careers.vizlib.com/) for current opportunities), where these efficiency gains will have a massive impact. On top of that, CAPEX expenditures can be reduced as there is no need for overpowered machines anymore.

That's great! I'm here to help you achieve this. 👍\n\nIn this guide, I will be using Gitpod, a free developer service that makes it easy for maintainers to automate any non-executable setup instructions as code. If you follow it, you will end up with a button that launches pre-configured containers for your project, thus allowing everyone to check out your repository and run your code in a single click.\n\nThe first thing you'll probably want to do is try opening your repository in Gitpod. You can do this by navigating to your GitHub project root, and then typing `gitpod.io/#` before the URL. It should look a bit like this:\n\n```bash\ngitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/website","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/guides/gitpodify","loc":{"lines":{"from":40,"to":49}}}}],["1356",{"pageContent":"<br>\n\nWhen you see the IDE and Terminal, just try building and running your project as usual.

You will then replace `preBootstrapCommands` with your bootstrap script under a new section labeled `overrideBootstrapCommand`.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/reference-architecture/_chunks/cluster","loc":{"lines":{"from":295,"to":300}}}}],["2877",{"pageContent":"```bash\naws ec2 describe-images --owners 099720109477 \\\n    --filters 'Name=name,Values=ubuntu-eks/k8s_1.22/images/*' \\\n    --query 'sort_by(Images,&CreationDate)[-1].ImageId' \\\n    --executable-users all \\\n    --output text --region us-west-2","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/reference-architecture/_chunks/cluster","loc":{"lines":{"from":302,"to":307}}}}],["2878",{"pageContent":"Refer to `eksctl`'s documentation on [AMI Family](https://eksctl.io/usage/custom-ami-support/) for more information on its behavior.\n\n</details>\n\n<br/>\n\n**`gitpod-cluster.yaml`**\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5\nkind: ClusterConfig\nmetadata:\n  name: gitpod\n  region: eu-west-1\n  version: \"1.22\"\n  # update tags to ensure all generated resources have atleast these tags applied\n  tags:\n    department: demo\n    project: gitpod\n\niam:\n  withOIDC: true","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/reference-architecture/_chunks/cluster","loc":{"lines":{"from":310,"to":331}}}}],["2879",{"pageContent":"iam:\n  withOIDC: true\n\n  serviceAccounts:\n    - metadata:\n        name: aws-load-balancer-controller\n        namespace: kube-system\n      wellKnownPolicies:\n        awsLoadBalancerController: true\n    - metadata:\n        name: ebs-csi-controller-sa\n        namespace: kube-system\n      wellKnownPolicies:\n        ebsCSIController: true\n    - metadata:\n        name: cluster-autoscaler\n        namespace: kube-system\n      wellKnownPolicies:\n        autoScaler: true\n    - metadata:\n        name: cert-manager\n        namespace: cert-manager\n      wellKnownPolicies:\n        certManager: true\n    - metadata:\n        name: external-dns\n        namespace: external-dns\n      wellKnownPolicies:\n        externalDNS: true\n\n# Uncomment and update for your region if you wish to use fewer availability zones\n# availabilityZones:\n#   - eu-west-1a\n#   - eu-west-1b\n#   - eu-west-1c","metadata":{"source":"https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/reference-architecture/_chunks/cluster","loc":{"lines":{"from":331,"to":365}}}}],["2880",{"pageContent":"# Uncomment and update for your region if you wish to use fewer availability zones\n# availabilityZones:\n#   - eu-west-1a\n#   - eu-west-1b\n#   - eu-west-1c\n\n# By default we create a dedicated VPC for the cluster\n# You can use an existing VPC by supplying private and/or public subnets.
